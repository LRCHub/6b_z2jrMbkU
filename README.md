[00:01.61] 幾つの苦も美観主義
[00:04.53] 愛の反戦 (oh) 一人じゃんけん (ah-ha)
[00:09.06] 運命と縛り見ない振り
[00:11.55] それも暗転
[00:13.95] Now I know all about you babe
[00:28.45] 
[00:16.30] I don't want the handbags, the money or the diamond rings
[00:19.86] 'Cause guys like you they all don't care about the little things
[00:23.00] まぁ anyway 吹っ切れた訳で
[00:26.29] 棒に当たって吠えたって圏外です
[00:33.79] 
[00:30.86] I'm moving on and I'm never ever turning back around, around, around again
[00:36.98] Now, I'll go higher and I'll go higher
[00:40.77] And you couldn't take me down if you tried
[01:01.77] 
[00:44.63] ばら撒いてた愛取返し撤退だ
[00:48.82] Now I can finally open my eyes
[00:51.97] そんで来世もっかい君への返品サイン
[00:56.17] Getcha out of my life boy
[00:57.64] I'll getcha, getcha, getcha
[01:11.14] 
[00:59.16] 待ちっぱなしの恋なんで
[01:02.71] 錠をかけキー捨て去って
[01:06.46] 'Cause I'm fine, I'm alright
[01:08.29] 君なしで大正解
[01:10.66] Getcha out of my life boy

[01:50.73] I'm moving on and I'm never ever turning back around, around, around again
[01:56.92] Now, I'll go higher and I'll go higher
[02:00.84] And you couldn't take me down if you tried
[02:21.84] 
[02:04.50] ばら撒いてた愛取り返し撤退だ
[02:08.81] Now I can finally open my eyes
[02:11.81] 今までにない待ちわびた最終回
[02:16.22] Getcha out of my life boy
[02:17.73] I'll getcha, getcha, getcha
[02:31.23] 
[02:21.00] All the lies and every mistake

[02:55.39] 流されてけスライダー outta way
[03:05.39] 
[02:57.59] 盲目な愛が溶けてくアイスバー
[02:59.53] もろく砕け泡が抜けたソーダ
[03:01.50] からって no pressure
